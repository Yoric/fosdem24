# Quantum computing?

- Compute with qubits, not bits.
- Still very much open research.

# Why quantum?

- Today's processors fight quantum physics.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.

# Why quantum?

- Today's processors fight quantum physics.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.
    - Faster?
    - Much more energy-efficient?

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Why quantum?

- Today's processors fight quantum physics.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.
    - Also, get out of the current hardware dead end.

# Digital

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Digital

- A program is a _circuit_.
- Programming languages exist.

# Digital

- A program is a _circuit_.
- Programming languages exist.
    - ... for model hardware.

# Analog

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Analog 

- A program is geometry + pulses.
- Maps naturally to hardware constraints.

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Analog 

- A program is geometry + pulses.
- Maps naturally to hardware constraints.
    - ...and to some classes of problems.

# Analog 

- A program is geometry + pulses.
- Maps naturally to hardware constraints.
- ... how do you program _that_?

# Analog

    \overbrace{
      \frac{\Omega}{2}\left[\cos(\phi) \hat \sigma^x_i - \sin(\phi) \hat \sigma^y_i \right] 
    - \delta \hat n_i
    }^\text{Programmable laser pulse, global interaction}
