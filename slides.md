# About Pasqal

- We build quantum computers.
- Also, some code.

# Quantum computing?

TBD

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Why?

- Processors have been using quantum effects for many years.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.

# Why?

- Processors have been using quantum effects for many years.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.
- Faster?
- Much more energy-efficient?
- Also, get out of the current hardware dead end.

# Two flavours

- Digital
- Analog

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Two flavours

- Digital
    - Circuits built from gates.
    - Somewhat easy to program.

- Analog

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Two flavours

- Digital
    - Circuits built from gates.
    - Somewhat easy to program.
    - But the hardware doesn't really exist.

- Analog

# Two flavours

- Digital
- Analog
    - Circuits built from interactions ("hamiltonians").
    - Can encode _directly_ some interesting problems.

# Qadence

A toolkit designed to:

- experiment with Digital + Analog circuits;
- without having to deal with lasers;
- simulate or execute circuits;
- _optimize_ circuits wrt noise and other constraints.
