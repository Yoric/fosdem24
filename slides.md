# Qadence

A framework for experimenting with analog/digital quantum computing

[comment]: # (!!!)


# About Pasqal

- We build quantum computers.
- Also, some quantum code.

# Quantum computing?

TBD

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Why?

- Processors have been using quantum effects for many years.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.

# Why?

- Processors have been using quantum effects for many years.
- Aiming for the next generation(s) of hardware.
- Faster?
- Much more energy-efficient?
- Also, get out of the current hardware dead end.

# Two flavours

- Digital
- Analog

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Digital

TBD: Example of a digital circuit.

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Digital

- A program is a _circuit_.
- Programming languages exist.

# Digital

- A program is a _circuit_.
- Programming languages exist.
- ... but the hardware isn't quite there yet.

# Analog

TBD: Example of an analog register.

[comment]: # (!!! data-auto-animate)

# Analog 

- A program is geometry + pulses.
- Can (mostly) run on hardware.

# Analog 

- A program is geometry + pulses.
- Can (mostly) run on hardware.
- ... how do you program _that_?

# Analog

TBD: The Hamiltonian from the Qadence slidedes.

TBD: Illustration of a pulse.

# Qadence

A toolkit designed to:

- experiment with Digital + Analog circuits;
- without having to deal with lasers;
- simulate or execute circuits;
- _optimize_ circuits wrt noise and other constraints.

# Digital

TBD: The same circuit, as source code.

(mention blocks)

[comment]: # (!!!)

TBD: Launch simulation, show result.

# Analog

TBD: A circuit for MaxCut/QAOA.

(mention parameters)

[comment]: # (!!!)

TBD: Train the circuit.

(mention differentiation)

[comment]: # (!!!)

TBD: Launch simulation, show result.

# Conclusions

# Conclusions

- A toolkit for exploring quantum circuit design.
- Because quantum hardware isn't fully there.
- Not a programming language
    - ...yet


# Outline

FIXME:

- Need to show gates
- Need to show registers
- Show execution
- Fixed / feature parameter
- Variational parameter
